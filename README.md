## Installation

First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) on your computer. You will also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to follow these instructions.

After that open the [Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Console) (or [Terminal](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)>) if you have macOS) and type the following command:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 -b master https://github.com/iptv-org/epg.git
```

Then navigate to the downloaded `epg` folder:

```sh
cd epg
```

And install all the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the download of the guide, select one of the [supported sites](SITES.md) and paste its name into the command below:

```sh
npm run grab -- --site=example.com
```

And once the download is complete, the guide will be saved to the `guide.xml` file.

```sh
Usage: npm run grab -- [options]

Options:
  -s, --site <name>             Name of the site to parse
  -c, --channels <path>         Path to *.channels.xml file (required if the "--site" attribute is
                                not specified)
  -o, --output <path>           Path to output file (default: "guide.xml")
  -l, --lang <code>             Filter channels by language (ISO 639-2 code)
  -t, --timeout <milliseconds>  Override the default timeout for each request
  -d, --delay <milliseconds>    Override the default delay between request
  --days <days>                 Override the number of days for which the program will be loaded
                                (defaults to the value from the site config)
  --maxConnections <number>     Limit on the number of concurrent requests (default: 1)
  --cron <expression>           Schedule a script run (example: "0 0 * * *")
  --gzip                        Create a compressed version of the guide as well (default: false)
```

### Access the guide by URL

You can make the guide available via URL by running your own server:

```sh
npm run serve
```

After that, the guide will be available at the link:

```
http://localhost:3000/guide.xml
```

In addition it will be available to other devices on the same local network at the address:

```
http://<your_local_ip_address>:3000/guide.xml
```

### Parallel downloading

By default, the guide for each channel is downloaded one by one, but you can change this behavior by increasing the number of simultaneous requests using the `--maxConnections` attribute:

```sh
npm run grab -- --site=example.com --maxConnections=10
```

But be aware that under heavy load, some sites may start return an error or completely block your access.

### Use custom channel list

Create an XML file and copy the descriptions of all the channels you need from the [/sites](sites) into it:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<channels>
  <channel site="arirang.com" lang="en" xmltv_id="ArirangTV.kr" site_id="CH_K">Arirang TV</channel>
  ...
</channels>
```

And then specify the path to that file via the `--channels` attribute:

```sh
npm run grab -- --channels=path/to/custom.channels.xml
```

### Run on schedule

If you want to download the guide automatically on a schedule, you need to pass a valid [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/) to the script using the `--cron` attribute:

```sh
npm run grab -- --site=example.com --cron="0 0 * * *"
```

## Update

If you have downloaded the repository code according to the instructions above, then to update it will be enough to run the command:

```sh
git pull
```

And then update all the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```
